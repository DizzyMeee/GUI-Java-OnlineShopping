## About The Project
Online shop application is an application used to facilitate people in their daily activities, such as business activities and shopping. The concept of the online shop application that we created is, an application that can be used by admins and costumers. Admins can perform the action of adding, editing, and deleting items they sell. While costumer can only find and buy goods and print what he buys.

The application is built with Netbeans and Eclipse software, using the Programming Language Java language, and its database using Microsoft SQL Server 2014. This is an application based on java swing and has implemented the CRUD. The application is created with a database containing several tables, namely the admin table that contains; admin id, admin email, and admin password. Then the costumer table contains; ID, first name, full name, email, birth date, address, phone, and password. Then there is the product table that contains; product name, category, stock, and price.

This application is desktop or does not need to be connected to the internet and made so that it can be used by anyone, including people who may not be very tech savvy. The application is also lightweight, so it can be used by computers with both low and high specifications. 

## Built With
* Java
* Swing
* SQL

## How To Use
First, you can download the files that are already available in our repository. The most important thing is how to connect the database to the application. You can connect it through your java text editor, and don't forget to change the username and password based on your Microsoft SQL Server account. If you using another application you can edit the ConnectionSQL.java section for connecting the data.
After that, you can run the file and the first thing you see is a frame login that which can bring you to an online shopping frame for customer or manage product for admin or you can register a new account for a new account for customer.
